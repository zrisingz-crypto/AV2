Launch.py - Parse the TestCmd.log file and submit encoding jobs to the grid.

This script reads the *_TestCmd.log file, parses job markers, and submits
the pre-generated shell scripts to the compute cluster.

Usage:
    python Launch.py [log_file_name]

Examples:
    python Launch.py                        # Auto-find *_TestCmd.log in WorkPath
    python Launch.py AV2CTC_TestCmd.log     # Use specified file in WorkPath
    python Launch.py /path/to/TestCmd.log   # Use full path

If no argument is provided, the script will look for *_TestCmd.log in the
WorkPath defined in config.yaml. If only a filename is provided (without path),
it assumes the file is located under WorkPath.
